I am a Mathematics Major at CSUF. I am graduating in May 2024, and I will be taking graduate courses at CSUF in the Teaching Credential Program with the hopes of becoming a High School Mathematics Teacher.

## Favorite CSUF 120L Labs

* Lab 2

  This lab was one of my favorites because I love madlibs. Creating the code to prompt a user to submit nouns and verbs was fun, interactive, and could create ridiculous statements. I even showed this code to my mom, and she was able to create a fun statement about how dogs could fit into a computer.

* Lab 8, Part 2

  This lab was very interesting because it revolved around creating a pattern, and thus, quickly became one of my favorites. As a mathematician, I look for patterns in all forms, and when I find one, I love to admire the beauty of these patterns. Being able to both code and create a pattern from scratch was extremely fun, and I loved this lab.

* Lab 9, Part 2

  This was another one of my favorite labs because I love playing games. It was even more fun to create an interactive game that could be played with friends. The secret number game was a perfect example of this kind of activity, and it was fun to learn how to code.
